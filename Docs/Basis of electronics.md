## Ohm's Law

Current: measured in Ampere, is the "quantity" of the flow
Voltage: measured in Volt, is like the "pressure" of a circuit
Reistamce: measured in Ohm, is the "opposition" to the flow 
  
Voltage (V) = Current (I) * Resistance (R)  
Current (I) = Voltage (V) / Reistance (R)  
Resistance (R) = Voltage (V) / Current (I)  

In a circuit the voltage changes between one point and another while the current is constant along all the circuit.    

Resistance (Resistor) is used to reduce the Current.  
For example, if we have a battery of 9V and we use it on a LED in a circuit with a 100Ω resistor, the LED will receive 0.09A (90 mA) of current, too much.  
Using a 450Ω resistor the Current wiill be reduced to 0.02A (20 mA) that is the right value.
