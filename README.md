# Learning Arduino (2)

This is a new repo because the other one is all set up to work with Arduino Community extension.  
Here I want to try VS Code with PlatformIO because the Arduino Community extension is not good to build the project:  
too hard and cumbersone to setup the project and still cannot solve the issue with include of external libraries.    
  
PlatformIO IDE extension installed and ready (Build + Upload) for a simple basic project in 10 minutes (it actually took many minutes to create the project), while it took at least 2 hours to configure the Arduino Community plugin !!
