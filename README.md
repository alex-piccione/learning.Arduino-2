# Learning Arduino

Arduino Development hints.  
Components.  
Electronic hints.

## Development

Arduino IDE is too limited. I want to use VS Code.   
I use VS Code with **PlatformIO** extension because the Arduino Community extension is not good to build the project:  
too hard and cumbersone to setup the project and still cannot solve the issue with include of external libraries.    
  
PlatformIO IDE extension installed and ready (Build + Upload) for a simple basic project in 10 minutes (it actually took many minutes to create the project), while it took at least 2 hours to configure the Arduino Community plugin !!  
  
### PlatformIO

It requires a platform.ini file, so the VS extension will recognize it and be able to activate intellisense, compiler, and all the features.  
How to create it? I forgot.  

## Components

There are components for everything.  
Look [here](Docs/Components.md).
